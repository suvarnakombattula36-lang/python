                                  Experiment 7
Program :7
Aim:Write a Python program that demonstrates inheritance by creating a base class Animal and derived classes like Dog and Cat with specific behaviors.
Software used:Colab (or) Jupyter Notebook
Description:
This program demonstrates inheritance in Python. A base class Animal is created with common behaviors (eat, sleep). Derived classes Dog and Cat extend the base class and include their own specific methods (bark, meow).

SOURCE CODE:
class Animal:
def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

def eat(self):
print(f"{self.name} is eating.")

def sleep(self):
print(f"{self.name} is sleeping.")

class Dog(Animal):
def bark(self):
print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

class Cat(Animal):
def meow(self):
print(f"{self.name} says Meow!")

dog1 = Dog("Buddy")
cat1 = Cat("Whiskers")

dog1.eat()
dog1.sleep()
cat1.eat()
cat1.sleep()

dog1.bark()
cat1.meow()
PROCEDURE:
1.	Define base class Animal with methods eat() and sleep().
2.	Define derived class Dog with method bark().
3.	Define derived class Cat with method meow().
4.	Create objects and demonstrate inheritance.
INPUT:
Dog("Buddy"), Cat("Whiskers")

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
Buddy is eating.
Buddy is sleeping.
Whiskers is eating.
Whiskers is sleeping.
Buddy says Woof!
Whiskers says Meow!
ACTUAL OUTPUT:
Buddy is eating.
Buddy is sleeping.
Whiskers is eating.
Whiskers is sleeping.
Buddy says Woof!
Whiskers says Meow!
