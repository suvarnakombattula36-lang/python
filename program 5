Program 5
Aim:Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list.
Software used:Collab (or) Jupyter Notebook
Description:
This program finds the largest number in a list by comparing each element. It starts with the first element as the largest and iterates through the list to update the maximum value.
SOURCE CODE:
defget_largest_number(numbers):
if not numbers:
return None
largest = numbers[0]
fornum in numbers[1:]:
ifnum> largest:
largest = num
return largest

my_list = [10, 45, 2, 99, 67, 88]
largest_number = get_largest_number(my_list)
print("The largest number is:", largest_number)

PROCEDURE:
1.	Define a function get_largest_number(numbers).
2.	Initialize the first element as the largest.
3.	Compare each element with the current largest.
4.	Update if a larger value is found.
5.	Return and print the largest number.


INPUT:
my_list = [10, 45, 2, 99, 67, 88]

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
The largest number is: 99

ACTUAL OUTPUT:
The largest number is: 99
