Program No.:2
Aim:Write a program that uses a for loop and while loop to print the numbers 8,11,14,â€¦,89.
Software used:Collab (or) Jupiter note book.
Description:
This simple program uses a for loop and while loop to print a sequence of numbers starting from 8 up to (but not including) 90, incrementing by 3 each time. Range (8, 90, 3) generates numbers starting from 8 and increases by 3 each time. The loop continues until the number reaches or exceeds 90 (but does not include 90). The while loop continues as long as num_while is less than or equal to 89. Prints each number in the sequence on a new line.
 
SOURCE CODE:
 FOR LOOP
print("Using a for loop:") 
fornum in range(8, 90, 3):
print(num)
 WHILE LOOP
print("Using a while loop:") 
num_while = 8
whilenum_while<= 89:
print(num_while) 
num_while += 3

PROCEDURE:
1. Print a heading: "Using a for loop or a while loop".
 2. Use a for loop to iterate from 8 to 89, increasing by 3 each time.
 3. Print each number in the sequence.
